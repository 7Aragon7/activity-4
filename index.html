    <h1>Student bio</h1>
    <p>Johnathan E. Aragon</p>
    <p>i was born on march 5th 1986. 
        it was a wednesday at 8:46 pm, it was a cold night, a dark night. 
        when the sounds of my screams filled the halls of the hospital room my mother knew her dream finally came true, since my name was already predetermined. 
        when she was a young girl, 7, she had a dream. 
        in this dream she was told her first born son had already a name picked out, Johnathan Edward. 
        a year later her family moved form waterville maine to ontario california. 
        in that little neighorhood she met a young boy name John Edward Aragon her futer husban and the rest is history. </p>
